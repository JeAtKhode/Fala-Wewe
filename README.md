<h1>FALA WEWE African Apparel Website</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project was part of an assignment during my second year of study in Software Engineering at Wintec. 
We worked in pairs to choose a concept, design, and finally build a fully functional website, which we later presented to a client. 
Our chosen concept was FALA WEWE, an e-commerce website dedicated to selling African-inspired apparel, showcasing authentic African designs to a wider audience.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The primary goal was to create a one-page website that serves as a storefront for FALA WEWE apparel. 
Our task was to build a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate platform where users could browse, learn about, and purchase clothing directly.

<h2>Features</h2>
The website includes the following sections:

Home: Welcoming landing page with introductory information.<br>
Shop: Display of available apparel items with images, prices, and descriptions.<br>
About Us: Background on the business and our inspiration behind FALA WEWE.<br>
Contact Us: Simple contact form and business contact information.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
Version Control: Git and GitHub<br>
Testing: Manual testing on multiple devices and browsers

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
This project offered hands-on experience in:

Working in a team environment with clearly defined roles
