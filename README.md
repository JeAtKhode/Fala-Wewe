  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project was part of an assignment during my second year of study in Software Engineering at Wintec. 
    We worked in pairs to choose a concept, design, and finally build a fully functional website, which we later presented to a client. 
    Our chosen concept was <em>FALA WEWE</em>, an e-commerce website dedicated to selling African-inspired apparel, showcasing authentic African designs to a wider audience.
  </p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The primary goal was to create a one-page website that serves as a storefront for <em>FALA WEWE</em> apparel. 
    Our task was to build a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate platform where users could browse, learn about, and purchase clothing directly.

  <ul>

    <li><strong>About Us:</strong> Background on the business and our inspiration behind <em>FALA WEWE</em>.</li>

    <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git and GitHub</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Manual testing on multiple devices and browsers</li>
