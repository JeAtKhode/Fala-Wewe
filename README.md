FALA WEWE African Apparel Website
Project Overview
This project was part of an assignment during my second year of study in Software Engineering at Wintec. 
We worked in pairs to choose a concept, design, and finally build a fully functional website, which we later presented to a client. 
Our chosen concept was FALA WEWE, an e-commerce website dedicated to selling African-inspired apparel, showcasing authentic African designs to a wider audience.

Objective
The primary goal was to create a one-page website that serves as a storefront for FALA WEWE apparel. 
Our task was to build a clean, modern, and easy-to-navigate platform where users could browse, learn about, and purchase clothing directly.

Features
The website includes the following sections:

Home: Welcoming landing page with introductory information.
Shop: Display of available apparel items with images, prices, and descriptions.
About Us: Background on the business and our inspiration behind FALA WEWE.
Contact Us: Simple contact form and business contact information.

Technologies Used
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Testing: Manual testing on multiple devices and browsers
